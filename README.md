- Use the filters to display only Income, Expenses, or all records.

## my Code 
## HTML
- My project includes four HTML files: index.html, create.html, edit.html, and delete.html.
- The index.html file serves as the main page, displaying the full list dynamically along with Create, Edit, and Delete buttons.
- The create.html file is used to create a new list entry.
- The create.html file collects data from the user using form elements like input fields and textareas.
- edit.html allows users to make changes to their existing entries.
- delete.html allows you to remove specific entries from the list.

## CSS
- The list is displayed using CSS Grid for a structured layout.
- Styles are applied to input fields and buttons.
- Make responsive layout.

## JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- Used to display data dynamically.
- Multiple pages are linked together and handled on a single page using DOM manipulation.

## CRUD Operation 
- The Create operation (C in CRUD) is handled using the Fetch API with a POST request.
- The Read operation (R in CRUD) uses the Fetch API with a GET request to retrieve data.
- The Update operation (U in CRUD) uses Fetch with PUT to send updated data to the server.
- The Delete operation (D in CRUD) uses a Fetch request with the DELETE method to remove data.

## Local Storage
- Local Storage is used to save data in the browser so that it persists even after the page is refreshed.

- These features are implemented in my Income and Expense Calculator project.
